Automated answers to a google forms sent through whatsapp

## What is This?

It is an automated solution to a real but very simple student problem.

## The problem

Volleyball matches are organized at the university with a maximum capacity of 24 participants. To determine who participates, a Google Form is sent via WhatsApp, and the first 24 people to fill out the form are eligible to play that day. Due to the academic workload, it is difficult to keep up with the WhatsApp messages in which the form is sent, and it is even more difficult to be among the fastest 24 to fill out the form because there are so many people waiting for it.

## Solution

 With this code, students can concentrate on their academic tasks without worrying about the form. This code allows them to automate the process of detecting a message with the form in a specific chat, filling it out, and sending it completely automatically and in the shortest possible time.
